# Spatial variability of voting turnout in the Netherlands
Term project for the MSc Applied Data Science course Spatial Statistics &amp; Machine Learning at Utrecht University.
Performed by Max van den Elsen (2590611), Sander Engelberts (1422138) and Thom Venema (1157485) in March-April 2022

This term project created a geographically weighted regression model to check for the spatial variability of voting turnout in the Netherlands. For this social demographics, population statistics and voting behaviour are used to check if these can explain differences in voting turnout. Using these findings, marketing can be more focussed to get more people to the polling stations.
