# Spatial variability of election turnout in the Netherlands
Term project for the MSc Applied Data Science course Spatial Statistics &amp; Machine Learning at Utrecht University.
Performed by Max van den Elsen (2590611), Sander Engelberts (1422138) and Thom Venema (1157485) in March-April 2022

This term project created among which a geographically weighted regression model to check for the spatial variability of election turnout among neighbourhoods in the Netherlands. For this social-economic, socio-demographics, and location variables are used to check if these can explain differences in election turnout. Using these findings, policies can be made more focussed to attract more people to the polling stations.
